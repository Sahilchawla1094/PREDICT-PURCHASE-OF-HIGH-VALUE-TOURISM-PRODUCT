#PREDICT PURCHASE OF HIGH VALUE TOURISM PRODUCT 

A reputed tourism company is planning to launch a long term travel package. The Product Manager has access to the existing customersâ€™ data and information. He wishes to analyse the trend of existing customers to figure out which customer is going to purchase the long term travel package. 
This project has two components. The analytical component requires you to perform exploratory data analysis using appropriate methods, handle missing values, handle class imbalance, build a bouquet of models and choose the best among the models as the final recommended model. 
The business component addresses the implications of your analysis. 

For the key stakeholder in this case, some important questions that you will need to answer are: 

a) Features in the dataset that help the business demarcate customers who purchase the 
long-term package, and how these could help the business acquire more such customers. 
It is important to keep your recommendations actionable, relevant to the context (i.e., 
tourism sector) and backed by the patterns from your analysis 

b) Features in the dataset that help the business identify customers who tend to purchase the short-term package, and if the business should avoid transacting with these customers. It 
is important to keep your recommendations actionable, relevant to the context (i.e., 
tourism sector) and backed by the patterns from your analysis 

c) Which among the features are not within the control of the business and on what do these features depend on (e.g., broader business climate) 
Beyond the indicative questions listed above, you are free to design and test few hypotheses 
about customer behavior that you observe in the dataset. You can use ideas from the statistics and analytics courses to frame and test your hypotheses (choice of tool could be KNIME, Excel or Python).
